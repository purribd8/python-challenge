Module 3 homework 

**Code is located in each respective Resources folder after opening the Pybank or Pypoll folder, and is called main.py**

I very much enjoyed this Module as I have now began to understand what needs to be done to complete these tasks, and successfully code. I was able to write this code thorough things I learned in class, the AI Xpert, questions I looked up, and also through adjusting the code based on things I learned in class.
